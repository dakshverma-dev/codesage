CodeSage – AI-Powered Interview Practice Platform
Overview

CodeSage is an interactive coding interview practice platform designed to simulate a real technical interview experience. The project focuses on helping users improve problem-solving skills through guided feedback, voice interaction, and real-time analysis.

This project was developed during a hackathon and emphasizes collaboration, rapid prototyping, and the practical application of computer science fundamentals.

Objectives

Simulate realistic technical interview scenarios

Encourage structured problem solving without revealing solutions

Provide meaningful feedback similar to a human interviewer

Explore the use of AI and voice interfaces in learning tools

Core Features
AI-Guided Interview Experience

Interactive AI interviewer providing feedback after each code execution

Guidance focused on approach, clarity, and optimization rather than answers

Real-time detection of time complexity and common algorithmic patterns

Suggestions for improvement based on detected solution strategies

Voice Interaction

Text-to-speech feedback for a more natural interview flow

Speech-to-text input to allow hands-free interaction

Cross-browser support with fallback mechanisms for reliability

Coding Environment

Integrated code editor with Python syntax highlighting

Real-time code execution and feedback loop

Multiple coding problems with progressive difficulty levels

Interview Metrics

Session time tracking

Code execution attempt counter

Optional hints with usage tracking

Performance feedback to reflect interview behavior
