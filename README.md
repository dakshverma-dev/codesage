CodeSage – AI-Powered Interview Practice Platform

CodeSage is an interactive coding interview practice platform designed to simulate a real technical interview experience. The project focuses on helping users practice problem solving while receiving structured, real-time guidance similar to that of a human interviewer.

This project was built as part of a hackathon and emphasizes rapid prototyping, collaboration, and applying computer science fundamentals in a time-constrained environment.

Project Goals

Simulate realistic coding interview scenarios

Provide guided feedback without revealing solutions

Encourage structured problem solving and optimization thinking

Explore the use of AI and voice interaction in learning tools

Key Features
AI-Guided Interview Experience

Interactive AI interviewer that provides feedback after each code execution

Guidance focused on approach and improvement rather than direct answers

Real-time analysis of time complexity and common coding patterns

Suggestions for potential optimizations based on detected approaches

Voice Interaction

Text-to-speech feedback for a more natural interview experience

Speech-to-text input for hands-free interaction

Browser-compatible implementation with fallback mechanisms for reliability

Coding Environment

Integrated code editor with Python syntax highlighting

Real-time code execution and feedback loop

Multiple coding problems with increasing difficulty levels

Interview Metrics

Session time tracking

Code execution attempt count

Optional hints with usage tracking

Performance feedback to reflect interview behavior

Tech Stack
